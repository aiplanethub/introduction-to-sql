## What is SQL?

SQL is the short form of Structured Query Language. It lets you access and manipulate databases. It has a wide variety of functions and tools and makes it possible for you to:
* execute queries against a database
* retrieve data from a database
* insert new records/rows
* update existing records/rows
* delete records/rows
* create a new database
* create new tables in an existing database
* create views in a database
* set permissions on tables, views, etc.

SQL is an ISO standard language. However, there are many different implementations of SQL (by different organizations), and each of them has its own proprietary features that might not be available in other implementations. However, the basic and major commands are part of the international standard and are supported by all implementations. 

As a beginner, you can therefore use any of the implementations for learning SQL; the syntax of basic commands will remain the same across all these different versions.

## Why SQL?

SQL is about **43** years old now, yet it is the third-most-popular programming language even today, according to the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2022](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#technology-most-popular-technologies). Why is SQL so popular, despite being so old?

Well, there are several reasons for this:
* High efficiency when it comes to tabular data
* Thoroughly tested through the years and remains the best option for relational databases
* Easily available knowledge and a huge community
* Simple and easy-to-learn
* Open-source and interoperability
* Queries are simpler and faster than writing code to do the same task
