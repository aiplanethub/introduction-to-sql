## Relational Databases

A Relational Database is a collection of tables containing related data. Each table in a Relational Database represents a specific real-world entity. Each table contains 'fields' or columns, which are characteristics that describe that real-world entity. 

Let us take an example to understand this better. Consider the students in a school to be our 'data'. Each student can now be considered a data point or 'row' of data. Let's say that within this overall data, we have one table for each class; that is, the students in class 1 fall under one table, students in class 2 fall under another table, and so on. 

Now, the characteristics of each student comprise the 'fields' or columns of each table; this can include details like Admission Number, Name, Section, Address, Phone Number, etc. 

This structure of related tables put together under a single collection is called a database. Often, since the data contained in the tables are related to each other, we end up identifying relations between the tables, and this is why such a database is called a 'relational' database. 

## Relational DataBase Management System (RDBMS)

A software that allows us to store, clean, analyze, manipulate, maintain and delete data from a Relational Database is called a Relational DataBase Management System, or RDBMS. 

An RDBMS serves many functions. Some of these include:
* Manage the Data stored in the Database
* View the data and perform analyses on it
* Act as an interface between users and the database
* Provide administrative functions for managing access and performance

SQL is one such tool. Many other tools can also help us achieve the basic functionality that SQL offers, but SQL is the most popular due to how flexible and powerful it is, and at the same time, its syntax is fairly intuitive, making it easy to learn. We will learn more about SQL in the next topic.
